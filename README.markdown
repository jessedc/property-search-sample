Property Search Example
=======================

A small sample application showing some common iPhone functionality:

- custom table views
- dealing with a web service
- asynchronous callbacks

External Libraries
------------------

To make life easier, the sample application has already integrated a number of third party libraries into the project:

- **LRResty** for network requests
- **YAJLiOS** for JSON parsing
- **MBProgressHUD** for loading spinner
- **SDWebImage** for asynchronously fetching photos
- **PullToRefreshView** for really easy integration of reloading results after user pulls down and releases on the table
